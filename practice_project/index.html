            <h2>POLITICS</h2>
            <h3>Unprecedented Fundraising</h3>
            <p>Political fundraisers are 'witnessing a remarkable surge' in terms of participation from Indian
                Americans. Ajay Bhutoria, a member of the Democratic National Finance Committee and fundraiser for over
                two decades, says, "More than ever, people are stepping up, contributing larger sums, and actively
                engaging in the political process."
                <br><br>
                The $145,000 median income of Indian American households is 21% higher than the overall US median.
                Shekar Narasimhan, founder and chairman of the AAPI Victory Fund, the largest Super PAC (political
                action committee) in the Asian American diaspora, says that even though it is not easy to find accurate
                data on how much finance Indian Americans are pumping into campaigns, there are huge donors in the
                community. This is evident from the fact that the Democratic National Finance Committee is 5%
                Indian-American even as their share in the US population is only 1%. At the same time, small-dollar
                donors are important too, adds Narasimhan.
                <br><br>
                M.R. Rangaswami, Indiaspora's Founder & Chairman, also notes the remarkable volume of funds being
                generated. "Now we have two healthy PACs with the AAPI Victory Fund and the Indian American Impact Fund,
                so more and more money is coming in," he says. The Indian American Impact, the largest desi PAC, is also
                identifying and training the next batch of leaders.

                Dr Sangay Mishra, associate professor of Political Science at Drew University and author of Desis
                Divided: The Political Lives of South Asian Americans, found in his research that since 2012, Indian
                Americans have been "very visible" in "bundling" contributions for campaigns. "We have seen that kind of
                outsized influence because of the number of very wealthy fundraisers organised in the community
                networks," he says.
                <br><br>
                It's a popular saying that the road to the White House goes through Silicon Valley - the hub of affluent
                Indians in tech. Harris's recent California fundraisers generated $55 million over a weekend; she has
                raised a billion dollars since becoming the nominee. Powerful fundraisers, including the one hosted by
                the billionaire AI investor and technologist Vinod Khosla for the Democratic campaign this election
                cycle, made news waves. There are more than 60 Indian names on the list of VCs for Kamala. Other
                business leaders and founders endorsing her include corporate leaders like Indra Nooyi.
                <br><br>
                The Enduring Republican Vote
                While Harris's candidacy has further loosened the purse strings of enthused Democrats, Donald Trump's
                Indian American supporters, including Vivek Ramaswamy, have stayed loyal to the Republican Party.
                <br><br>
                Sampat Shivangi, an old-time Republican faithful and the only Indian American delegate at the Republican
                National Convention this year, has been elected to the body for the sixth time. He is sending a big
                cheque for Trump's campaign. Then there is hotelier Danny Gaekwad, who has contributed to the campaigns
                of every Republican Presidential candidate since George Bush. "The October event involved an insane
                amount of money. People known to me are calling me - Bhau, I want to go, my wife wants to go," Gaekwad
                says about a sold-out fundraiser.
                <br><br>
                Republicans like Shivangi say they support Trump because "Harris is not a friend of India". Along with
                accusations of "diluting" her Indian American identity, they point out that she failed to visit India
                during her years as Vice-President.

                Republicans, however, do acknowledge that the fervour among Indian American supporters of the party,
                especially Hindus, has waned since 2020, when President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
                friendly ties created a huge buzz. "{Perhaps because] he is a third-time candidate," Gaekwad reasons.
                <br><br>
                Though wooed by both parties, by and large, Indian Americans have voted for Democrats. A 2024 AAPI Data
                survey found that 55% of Indian Americans identify as Democrats, 25% as Republicans and 15% as
                Independents.
                <br><br>
                Sway In Swing States
                The Indian American community is critical for both parties because even though they make up only 1% of
                the US population, about a third of them reside in Presidential battleground states like Michigan and
                Georgia, where they can play a huge role in shaping the results. Recalling the narrow Democratic victory
                in Georgia in 2020, Mishra says, "In a state like that, it matters because the margin was so thin.
                Indian Americans voted one way and the election went that way, if they had voted the other way results
                might have been different." The last few Presidential elections have been close calls, decided by narrow
                gaps in a handful of states. Polls show that the current one seems evenly poised. There are nearly
                4,00,000 voters of South Asian descent in the 10 most contested swing states. "There is a sizeable
                number of Indian Americans who can make a difference," says Dr Mishra.
                <br><br>
                Thus, volunteers of the highly politically engaged community utilise their resources strategically in
                pivotal states. Based in the Democratic stronghold California, Sangeeta Ramakrishnan is They See Blue's
                'lead' for swing state calls. She says, "There are more of us in blue states and because you don't need
                to knock those many doors here, it's better to use our resources effectively."
                <br><br>
                Every election, Pennsylvania's Buck's County gains the reputation of being the "swingiest county in the
                swingiest state". Rupa Mohan, a volunteer at They See Blue, says, "We have phone banks run by Gujarati
                volunteers, Malayalam speakers, Urdu speakers. We have a whole pile of different volunteers lined up."
                <br><br>
                Overall as well, the political participation of the 4.8 million-strong young immigrant community is
                soaring. In the last two presidential elections, they had the highest voter turnout among Asian
                Americans, on par with white voter turnout. As many as 71% of eligible Indian Americans voted in 2020, a
                9-point increase from 2016. This trend is expected to continue. A recent Asian American voter survey
                shows that around 91% of Indian Americans plan to vote in this election.

            <h3>KOHLI'S DISMISSAL</h3>
            <p>Kohli's dismissal left India captain Rohit Sharma in complete shock. His reaction captured the weight of
                the moment, highlighting just how crucial Kohli's wicket was for India.
                As the team relied on their talisman to guide them through a challenging phase, the timing of the
                dismissal made the setback even more significant.
                Kohli also crossed the 9,000 Test runs milestone, becoming only the fourth Indian to achieve this feat,
                following in the footsteps of Sachin Tendulkar (15,921), Rahul Dravid (13,265), and Sunil Gavaskar
                (10,122).
                Despite a shaky start, during which he took 14 balls to score his first run, Kohli eventually settled
                in, hitting eight fours and a six as he found his rhythm.</p>

            <h3>Babar Azam Leads Reactions As Pakistan Thrash England To Level Series 1-1 In Multan</h3>

            <p>Pakistan levelled the three-match Test series with a comprehensive 152-run victory over England in the
                second Test at Multan Cricket Stadium. The win came courtesy of a dominant display by Pakistan's
                spinners, who made full use of a re-used pitch, bowling England out for 144 before lunch on Day 4. The
                result sets up a thrilling series decider in Rawalpindi next week, with the series tied 1-1. Chasing a
                challenging target of 297, England batters were undone by left-arm spinner Noman Ali, who claimed seven
                of the eight wickets that fell on the fourth morning, finishing with figures of 8-46 in the second
                innings and 11-147 overall in the match.


                Noman, along with off-spinner Sajid Khan, who took nine wickets across the two innings, exposed
                England's vulnerability to spin on a turning surface. Together, they achieved the rare feat of sharing
                all 20 wickets between them, something that has happened only seven times in Test history.

                The key to Pakistan's victory was credited to their selection and the pitch conditions. After a
                humiliating defeat in the first Test, where England posted a record-breaking 823-7 declared, Pakistan
                responded with radical changes.

                They dropped former captain Babar Azam, along with pace bowlers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah,
                opting for a spin-heavy attack on a reused Multan pitch. The move paid dividends as Noman and Sajid spun
                England into submission, making the most of a sharp turn and unpredictable bounce.

            <h3>Leading Brazil Toward a Just Energy Future</h3>
            <p>Audrey Plimpton, Communications Associate: In one sentence, what does a just transition from oil, gas,
                and fossil fuels mean for Brazil?
                <br>
                João Marcos Paes Leme, Director of the Energy Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brazil: It means
                we have to devise how to do it, not if we should do it.

                AP: What are the benefits of implementing just energy transitions, both in Brazil and worldwide?
                <br><br>
                JMPL: Energy transitions, as I see it, are more than energy. It's actually a process leading to a new
                economic paradigm. Since we're moving from one cycle to the next, I think we should try to avoid the
                problems we had in the previous system and the traps that the new one might have in store for us. It has
                to deliver more justice to be inclusive; we usually call them just and inclusive transitions [to include
                the] social aspects of it. It has to, of course, decarbonize and move to cleaner forms of producing and
                consuming energy. The urgency of climate change doesn't allow us much time to start doing what we have
                to do.
                <br><br>
                AP: How can evidence-based research be better integrated into policymaking to ensure that just
                transitions are effectively implemented?
                <br><br>
                JMPL: This is a very important issue. As countries rush into new technological pathways to try to
                address the task of decarbonizing and transitioning to cleaner forms of energy production and
                consumption, we have to be very careful in assessing each of these paths without prejudging them, but
                also based on scientific and objective criteria. The most relevant thing is to assess each of them by
                the carbon intensity and life cycle analysis and all these scientific and objective considerations of
                the options so that we don't end up with solutions that are promoted for another reason that is not
                science-based decision making. These criteria should be comparable [and] should be from the beginning to
                the end of the cycle so that we know what solutions are more adequate to the situation. Of course, this
                also has to take into consideration the circumstances of individual countries [and] regions or even
                regions within a country.
                <br><br>
                A big country like Brazil has different realities. In Brazil we have made choices in the past that help
                us today have an energy mix that is already much cleaner than most – the cleanest among the world’s
                largest economies, at any rate. We also have some experiences to share that may be useful for other
                countries in similar circumstances.
                <br><br>
                AP: How can we better align international conversations and commitments with domestic policy planning
                and implementation?
                <br><br>
                JMPL: This is an important question for us in particular, as Brazil is currently the president of G20
                and next year, will be hosting COP 30. One issue that we've been trying to promote, among others, is the
                importance of energy planning within countries because the implementation of international commitments
                will, of course, be done by countries individually. There is a wide gap in the capacity of implementing
                and designing energy planning policies within countries. This is something we've been discussing in the
                G20. Another issue that affects countries very disproportionately is the ability to finance the
                transition. The studies that have been looking into this show that there's a disproportion of
                investments being made in cleaner technologies or in transitions in developed countries, far more than
                in developing countries. As we know, climate change doesn't respect borders. Part of this investment
                should head to developing countries as well so that they can work on their transitions at a pace
                compatible with the situation we are living [in].
                <br><br>
                João Marcos Paes Leme attended the "Policy Dialogue on Just Energy Transitions: Identifying Pathways to
                Prosperity Post Fossil Fuels" in September 2024.
